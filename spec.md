# 🧬 Health Archetypes – Local Demo Spec (LLM + Image Gen Edition)

A fast, privacy-first, no-login web demo where users connect their wearable, get a one-of-a-kind **Health Archetype**, and copy a beautifully generated card to share with friends.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Tagline:**

> A unique health vibe, powered by your real data.

**Core experience:**

1. User connects their wearable (via Terra)
2. AI analyzes their health data
3. A custom archetype + avatar is generated
4. Data is deleted — session-based only, no tracking

---

## 🎨 Copy & Tone

**Voice:**

- Playful, creative, non-judgemental
- Inspired by video game classes, MBTI, and personality types
- Avoid clinical terms like "score", "diagnosis", or "medical condition"

**Tone examples:**

- "A snapshot of your fitness energy."
- "You’re more than your stats. But here’s your style."
- "Your data? Already wiped like a pro cooldown stretch."

---

## 🖼️ App Flow

### Frame 1: Landing Page

- 📝 Light intro explaining:

  - No login or signup
  - Just one personalized profile
  - Everything is local and deleted after

- 🟢 CTA: “Connect Your Wearable” (launches Terra Widget)

---

### Frame 2: Progress Stepper

Stepper shows live feedback through the following phases:

| Step | Label                | Copy                                                   |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Device Connected     | “Wearable linked — syncing your data flow 🛰️”          |
| 2    | Health Data Obtained | “Cracking open your past workouts, sleep, and vitals…” |
| 3    | Archetype Discovered | “Channeling your energy into a one-of-a-kind vibe… 🧘‍♂️” |
| 4    | Data Cleared         | “Data deleted. Nothing saved. You’re all set 🧼”       |

---

### Frame 3: Archetype Card

**Displays:**

- 🧠 Generated **Archetype Name** and Description
- 🖼 **Low-poly AI-generated image** of the character
- 🎚 **5 consistent health trait sliders**
- 🧍 Optional name (entered by user)
- 📤 CTA: “Copy My Archetype” → converts the card to PNG and copies to clipboard

---

## 🖼 Archetype Design System

Generated by an LLM (e.g. GPT-4 or Gemini) using a structured system prompt and real health data.

**Always includes:**

- Archetype Name (max 3 words)
- Short description
- 5 key slider values (0–100)
- AI Image prompt (low-poly style)

---

## 🎚 The 5 Sliders (Static Dimensions)

These are the **same across all users** but each archetype reflects unique values.

| Slider               | What it captures                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Recovery Readiness   | HRV, sleep quality, rest days                         |
| Activity Load        | Exercise intensity, frequency, strain                 |
| Sleep Stability      | Sleep timing consistency, depth, wake-ups             |
| Heart Rhythm Balance | Resting heart rate vs active, variability             |
| Consistency          | Regularity across sleep, workouts, recovery behaviors |

---

## 🤖 LLM Archetype Generation Prompt

Used to generate name, description, image style, and sliders.

> SYSTEM PROMPT:

```
You are a personality designer generating unique health archetypes based on biometric and lifestyle data. These are not diagnoses — they’re symbolic digital profiles, expressed visually and narratively.

For each user, generate:

1. Archetype Name (max 3 words, title case)
2. Archetype Description: A 1–2 sentence summary of the person’s health "vibe" and strengths
3. A low-poly image prompt: Describe a digital character in a stylized polygonal art style. Human character, geometric features, bold lighting and colors. Include scene/background. Avoid realism or animals.
4. Slider values (0–100) for the following 5 health traits:
   - Recovery Readiness
   - Activity Load
   - Sleep Stability
   - Heart Rhythm Balance
   - Consistency

Style references: Symbolic, expressive, vibrant low-poly avatars. No logos or brand names.
```

## 🔗 Shareability

- No URLs or persistent links
- User can **copy/download their archetype card** as an image
- Optional name appears on card
- Uses `html-to-image` or `dom-to-image` library to capture DOM node

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### Frontend

| Tool             | Purpose                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| React (via Vite) | Component rendering                |
| Tailwind CSS     | Styling                            |
| Chakra UI        | Beautiful accessible UI components |
| html-to-image    | Export card as image               |

### Backend

| Tool              | Purpose                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Node.js (Express) | Hosts API endpoints locally      |
| OpenAI API        | LLM + image generation           |
| In-memory JSON    | Holds session data (no database) |
| Terra API         | Pulls user health metrics        |

### Data Handling

- No persistent database
- All data is held in RAM (temporary JSON object)
- Deleted after archetype is shown

---

## 🧪 Terra Data Strategy

Use Terra's standard normalized health metrics from:

- `/daily`: sleep, heart rate, activity levels
- `/activity`: workouts, intensity
- `/sleep`: detailed sleep trends
- `/body`: body comp if available
- Fetch 30–90 days of data

> You only need enough data to extract a stable health profile. No deep historical processing needed.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Ephemerality

- All processing is done in memory
- No data persisted to disk or external services
- Data wiped after archetype generation
- User sessions are non-identifiable

---
