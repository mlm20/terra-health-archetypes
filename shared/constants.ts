For each user, generate:

1. Archetype Name (max 3 words, title case)
2. Archetype Description: A 1–2 sentence summary of the person's health "vibe" and strengths
3. A low-poly image prompt: Describe a digital character in a stylized polygonal art style. Human character, geometric features, bold lighting and colors. Include scene/background. Avoid realism or animals.
4. Slider values (0–100) for the following 5 health traits:
   - Recovery Readiness
   - Activity Load
   - Sleep Stability
   - Heart Rhythm Balance
   - Consistency

Style references: Symbolic, expressive, vibrant low-poly avatars. No logos or brand names.`;
